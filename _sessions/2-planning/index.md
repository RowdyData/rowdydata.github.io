The [Starting off workshop](1-starting) explored the implementation schedule and how IATI can work (be useful, be implemented) in your organisation.

This second workshop is intended to deepen that understanding, and work towards a first draft plan for implementation.

## Topics

-   Background on rights, licenses, coverage, and exclusions.
-   Basics of what an "activity" is in your organisation.
-   Blueprint of an implementation plan.
-   Understanding who needs to be "on the team".
