Housing for birds, although very basic in some cases, can also be nonexistent. Birds sleep in trees and natural sheds at night. The cost of inputs can be a small cash expense for the purchase of day-old chicks (in case own-stock hatching is not pursued) and some complementary feedstuffs. Birds are sold live locally or at farm gates, were motorized traders and middlemen purvey supplies to take to markets. Poultry are thus also an important source of cash income for low-income households.

On the basis of a good business plan they receive a starter loan. They then have 3 years to pay back their loan.  During the program the young entrepreneurs take on a practical assignment and are apprenticed to a local business.

Meatu district has a great potential for using solar energy with an average of eight hours of sun daily, but currently this potential is barely being used because of insufficient local awareness and capacities. Providing areas that are far from the national electricity grid with access to solar energy brings communities a wide range of advantages to improve economic activities and household wellbeing, for example by enabling (non-kerosine) lighting and mobile phones usage. This project will pursue three strategies to improve access to solar energy: 1. Investing in the establishment of solar enterprises will allow for the delivery of solar equipment to households and small local businesses through local markets. 2. By strengthening the infrastructure for installation and maintenance, the communitys capacity to operate the solar systems will be enhanced. 3) Setting up village savings and loans schemes will provide communities with the financial services that allow them to make the necessary investments in solar equipment.   The project builds upon a pilot project that is successfully being implemented in Meatu district since 2009. It scales up the activities and provide more households and local businesses with access to solar energy. The sustainability of results will be enhanced trough a refined social business approach. ICS will support the establishment and capacity enhancement of local solar enterprises, run by women and youth groups, that supply the community with solar panels and accessories on credit. By creating a local market for solar equipment and services, the project strengthens the capacity of communities to achieve positive social change in an entrepreneurial way.

Water will be pumped from existing community ponds, deep wells and rain water cisterns, and through water purification and sterilization, it will be made into quality safe drinking water.  In addition, this project will motivate people to use clean water, and spread awareness on water-borne diseases and other health issues that affect their children and families. The water filtration system will produce a finished product of safe drinking water stored in twenty litre bottles and lately for small bottles.  The bottled water will be produced safely and sustainably through a reliable, profitable procedure and be offered for purchase at an affordable price in the villages.  Through an innovative approach, the project will install necessary equipment using a combination of local resources, active filtration and UV  - Ultra Violet - and Ozone sterilization.  The project is expecting to have 1,600 families accessing the mineral water products which will be available through the village water sales agent of the mineral water enterprise.

The Commune Council also visited various types of project interventions in other provinces in order to expand their understanding and increase their skills in community development. An important key role of the Commune Council is making sure services are provided to its constituents.  This is accomplished through an annual process of Commune Council investment planning which helps them to prioritize where funds should be allocated. A major challenge exists in influencing the Commune Council to change their habits of focusing their funds mostly in infrastructure investment rather than allocating portions to support the socio-economic initiatives of their constituents. ICS has experience in engaging with the Commune Council and co invest with NGOs by not isolating the Commune Council, but rather actively engaging them in the process and work along with them.  ICS act as a bridge between the community, civil society and the Commune Council, and will strategically invest in the Commune Council (supply) and create strong demands from the civil society organization (CSOs.)","","","","","","","","","","","","2011-07-01","","Start Actual","2013-12-31","","End Planned","","","","","3","","Project Completion","","","","","","","","","Government and civil society, general","DAC","151","100","","","","","","","info@ics.nl","+310333030250","info@ics.nl","Smallepad 32, 3811 MG Amersfoort, The Netherlands","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2013-01-01","","2013-12-31","38110","2013-01-01","EUR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the current approach the project attempts to maximize its impact for rural communities in Meatu in general and their children in specific.  1000 households in remote areas that cannot be served through community water systems will have access to purification products that ensure safe drinking water.

By making parents aware of the impact of positive child-rearing, the atmosphere at home is improved and children are able to feel safer at home.  ICS has developed Skillful Parenting courses in which parents can learn about parenting skills. Subjects like self-worth and affirmation, conflict control within the family, positive discipline and child protection are covered. The usefulness of saving money, planning things together within the family, money management and setting financial priorities are examples of issues adressed in the trainings.

By gender more young women have reached primary levels of schooling. But young men are more likely to have had a secondary education. One factor contributing to this gender disparity is the lack of secondary schools in rural areas and the reluctance of many families to send their daughters to urban centres for education . One of the challenges in engaging the youth to become active participants in creating change in their society is in maximizing the participation of out-of-school youths (OSY) in rural communities. OSYs tend to migrate to urban areas in search for employment. In addition to this their degree of participation is limited by their knowledge and skills brought about by lack of basic education and life skills. The problems faced by children and youth are all interrelated. Rural poverty diminishes their likelihood of obtaining and completing basic education. The rural poor who migrate to the cities for work tend to be homeless and unemployed. Thus they are more likely to turn to criminal behaviours or take risky and exploitative employment. Through SKYE Cambodian youth are given relevant vocational and life skills training opportunities that will equip them to explore create and participate in social enterprise opportunities within their communit. Thus breaking the cycle of poverty which they find themselves in. By establishing the Society of Khmer Youth Entrepreneurs (SKYE) youth are given a stronger voice in the society and they will not just be a statistics representing the population. By SKYE opportunities for youth are opened in their own communities reducing the possibility of risky migration.","","","","","","","","","","","","2013-01-01","","Start Actual","2014-12-31","","End Planned","","","","","2","","Implementation","","","","","","","","","Government and civil society, general","DAC","151","100","","","","","","","info@ics.nl","+310333030250","info@ics.nl","Smallepad 32, 3811 MG Amersfoort, The Netherlands","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2013-01-01","","2013-12-31","106555","2013-01-01","EUR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most farmers that are engaged in beekeeping use traditional technologies, compromising both the quantity and quality of the honey that is produced. Additionally, beekeeping farmers only find access to local markets with small quantities, providing them with very limited returns. Making use of the commercial potential of beekeeping can provide farmers with an additional income through an activity that is not very labour-intensive. This way their primary activities on food production are not compromised. The additional income prevents them from being forced to sell other (cereal) produce that is needed for household consumption.    This project aims at improving the productivity and competitiveness of beekeeping farmers by investing in three areas: 1) training and linking them to extension services to improve their skills and knowledge on appropriate beekeeping technology, 2) improving the availability and access to quality beekeeping inputs, and 3) improving the market position of beekeepers to increase their returns from honey sales.
