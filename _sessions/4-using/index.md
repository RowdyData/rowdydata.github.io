In this workshop, participants learn how to use IATI data: how to create visualisations.

Making the data available and suitable for in-house use will help benefit from the efforts made to create the data set. It will also drive improvement of the data: errors and anomalies are often found through visualisations.

A list of tools that are easy to use:

-   Open Refine
-   Fusion tables
-   Excel
-   Piktochart
-   Infogr.am
-   RAW
-   CartoDB
-   XSLT transformations
-   EditiX XML tool
