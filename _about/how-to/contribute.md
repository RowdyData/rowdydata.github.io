title: How to contribute?
---

RowdyData is open for contributions. You will need to have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com) to add your requests or information.

There are three major ways to contribute:

* Report a problem or suggest an improvement.
* Directly edit the content (only for team members).
* Create a request to include your contribution.

We'll outline the process, and gradually introduce you to become an _open source contributor_!

## About GitHub

### GitHub account

GitHub is a place to collaborate on open source projects. If you don't have an account yet, simply go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign up. GitHub is free if you only use publicly available projects.

Each project in GitHub is held in a _repository_. Two parts of the repository are important for now:

#### Files and folders

The files and folders are managed by a _version control system_: you can edit one or more files, and save all the changes in a single _commit_ action.

Each commit is kept forever, so it is always possible to go back to an earlier version. For instance after making a mistake.

#### Issues

All suggestions for improvements and mistakes found can be registered on the _issue list_. Each issue has its own discussion, and a workflow: when we're ready to work on it, we'll give it a tag "Ready", when we are working on it, it will have a tag "In Progress", and the issue will be closed once we're done.

## Report a problem or suggest an improvement

This is the easiest way to help. Use the button at then end of the page:

<div class="btn btn-default"><a href="#"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pix/icon/svg/notification.svg"> report an issue</a></div>

Use the filter to check if someone else already reported it. If not, use the green "New issue" button to add it.

You can also read the discussions around issues, and maybe contribute by verifying a report or adding your insight.

## Directly edit the content

This only works if you are a team member: it allows you to directly edit any page on the website, by using the button at the end of the page:

<div class="btn btn-default"><a href="#"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pix/icon/prose_io.png"> edit (team only)</a></div>

You will go to a special web editor. First, you will need to give it permission to use your account.

## Create a request to include your contribution

This is relatively the hardest step. You create a _clone_ of our repository, make the edits you like to see, and then create a _Pull requst_ to ask us to include those edits in our repository.

Use the edit button at the end of the page to directly go to the source of that page:

<div class="btn btn-default"><a href="#"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pix/icon/svg/pencil.svg"> edit this page</a></div>

You will see the source from which the page was generated. Click the pencil in the top-right to start editing. GitHub will guide you through the steps.

## More information

There is a lot more you can learn about this process. We'll try to add relevant information over time. You may want to explore [the Guides provided by GitHub](https://guides.github.com/).
