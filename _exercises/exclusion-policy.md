  Discuss a fictitious project to find out about exclusion policy and thresholds.
---

This exercise uses a fictitious project profile as it may appear on your website, generated from your own data.

By discussing each element of that profile, you can develop an understanding of:

-   Exclusion policy: what criteria will you use when leaving out information?
-   Editorial policy: what needs to change in your internal information to make it more useful for outsiders.
-   Rights: what do you need to include in partnership agreements, contracts, and so on, in order to be allowed to publish something?

Use [the project profile from the 'Planning' session](../sessions/2-planning/Fictitious-project.pdf)
