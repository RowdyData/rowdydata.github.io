# Overview

In 2013 we started our Open Data programme where we help Dutch NGO's in their IATI implementation. The current programme runs until the end of 2015.

Central in our approach is a focus on high quality data sets and the practical uses of IATI data for individual organisations.

For this support we have developed and are developing tools that help organisation structure their IATI process. This page is meant to share some of those learnings with anyone that might need it.

We start with helping organisation identify how IATI can help their own strategic goals, and move beyond IATI as only a transparancy tool. We do this through a four step process: Starting to publish, planning your publication, data mapping & prototyping and data visualisation. We aim to help organisation work through this proces iteratively. Creating a prototype through [Aidstream](http://www.aidstream.org) takes a central role in this process.

## Materials

### Implementation schedule

Together with Rolf Kleef we have developed a new implementation schedule. The renewed implementation schedule helps organisation to structure their IATI implementation proces along four main steps. Starting to publish, planning to publish, data mapping and getting ready to publish. The Partos training programme is structured along the lines of these steps.
