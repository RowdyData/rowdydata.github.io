Partos is the Dutch association of NGOs working in International Development. In 2013 we started our Open Data programme where we help Dutch NGO's in their IATI implementation. We start with helping organisation identify how IATI can help their own strategic goals, and move beyond IATI as only a transparancy tool. We do this through a four step process: Starting to publish, planning your publication, data mapping & prototyping and data visualisation. We aim to help organisation work through this proces iteratively. Creating a prototype through Aidstream (www.aidstream.org) takes a central role in this process. 

The programme is free to our members and is financed by the Ministry of foreign affairs. If you would like to know more please email Jasper@partos.nl
